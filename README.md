# Bank notes
**Chiptune** - A minimal GM set using very tiny chiploop samples. Aims for the smallest size with the best sound. Under 14k.

**Pico** - A square wave that's mapped to all GM patches. Very loosely compatible. This is the most barebones bank.

**Freekia** - An effort to replicate the Nokia chippy bank found on phones such as the 3510, 7210, 3220, using only libre samples and instruments. Most of them are from other Beatnik banks. However, it isn't needed since Beatnik owns the rights to the small bank. It's going open source as of now.

**nPatches Lite / npatches-alaw.hsb** - A variation of SalterNokia with IMA-ADPCM and A-Law compressed samples.

**nanoSalt** - A very tiny version of SalterNokia that's under 10kb.
 
**nanoChip** - 8k version of the chiptune bank
